# Air_Quality_Dashboard

I have completed this Power BI project focused on visualizing the Air Quality Index (AQI) across different regions. This project effectively leverages Power BI's data transformation and visualization features to convert raw AQI data into actionable insights.

Key Components:

Data Preparation:
Imported and cleansed AQI datasets using Power Query Editor.
Built relationships between AQI data and a date dimension for time-based analysis.

Modeling and DAX:
Created calculated columns and measures for detailed analysis, including average and max AQI.

Dashboard Design:
Developed interactive visuals like trend charts, regional comparisons, and custom maps.
Enhanced aesthetics with custom visuals designed in PowerPoint.

Performance Optimization:
Applied data reduction techniques and optimized DAX calculations for better performance.

Deployment:
Published the dashboard to Power BI Service with real-time data refresh and role-based access control.

Outcome:
The final dashboard provides a comprehensive overview of air quality trends and anomalies, with the ability to quickly identify areas of concern. The use of advanced Power BI features such as DAX, custom visuals, and optimized performance ensures that the dashboard is both powerful and user-friendly, making it an invaluable tool for decision-makers and analysts alike
